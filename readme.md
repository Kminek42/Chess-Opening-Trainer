<h1>Chess Opening Trainer</h1>

I have created this application to learn french defense lines for black pieces. All lines to learn are stored in the txt file as sequence of moves.

I created this while I was in my first year of college when I was just learning python (I only knew C at the time), so the code is written in the procedural paradigm. My apologies to anyone trying to understand this code.
