<h1>Chess Opening Trainer</h1>

I have created this application because I wanted to learn french defense lines for black pieces. All lines to learn are stored in the txt file as sequence of moves.

One can run `python3 main.py` to see the application.

After each player's move, the opponent played by a computer plays the next move from sequence.

In case of forgetting the right move, one can use `hint` button to highligh right piece to play.

There are also many themes to chose from.

PS. I created this while I was in my first year of college when I was just learning python (I only knew C at the time), so the code is written in the procedural paradigm. My apologies to anyone trying to understand this code.
